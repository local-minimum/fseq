Welcome to fSeq!
================

fSeq is an extensible toolkit aimed at fast reading of sequence data with a
common interface for all types of sequences.
Upon that, the ability to encode the contents of the data into suitable numeric
formats prepares for the second part.

After reading contents *fSeq* allows for post-processing and report-making as
integral parts of its framework. 
*fSeq* comes with a small set of report builders and report makers, but these
have equally been designed to allow fast development of further capabilities.
